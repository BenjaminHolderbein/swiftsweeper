# SwiftSweeper

A native macOS Minesweeper that respects the classic game and embraces Liquid Glass. Pure SwiftUI, no ads, no in-app purchases.

## Features

- **Classic-faithful number palette.** Light mode uses the original Windows Minesweeper RGB values; dark mode preserves the same hue identities with lifted lightness.
- **Difficulty:** Easy (9×9 / 10), Medium (13×13 / 25), Hard (16×16 / 45), and a Custom sheet for any board from 5×5 up to 30×30.
- **Chord-click.** Hold left + right on a revealed numbered cell whose flag count matches the number to reveal every non-flagged neighbor. Mis-flag and you lose, just like the original.
- **Full keyboard control.** Arrow keys move a focus ring; Space reveals; F flags; Return chords; Enter / ⌘R starts a new game.
- **Standard macOS menu bar** with shortcuts for new game, difficulty, mute.
- **Sound.** Funk on win, Bottle on loss, gated by a mute toggle.
- **Persistent stats:** best time, total wins, win rate, total games.
- **Accessibility:** VoiceOver labels for the HUD; OS focus ring on standard controls.

## Requirements

- macOS 26 (Tahoe) — uses Liquid Glass APIs
- Swift 6.2 toolchain (Xcode 27+ or Swift CLI)

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BenjaminHolderbein/swiftsweeper.git
cd swiftsweeper
make install        # builds, bundles, copies to /Applications
```

Then launch from Spotlight or `/Applications/SwiftSweeper.app`. To uninstall: `make uninstall`.

## Run from source

```bash
make                # build + launch (uses .build/debug/SwiftSweeper.app)
make test           # run the XCTest suite
make clean          # remove build artifacts
```

## Controls

### Mouse

| Action | Effect |
|---|---|
| Left-click cell | Reveal |
| Right-click cell | Cycle flag → question → blank |
| Left + right (held) on numbered cell | Chord |

### Keyboard

| Key | Effect |
|---|---|
| Arrow keys | Move focus ring |
| Space | Reveal focused cell |
| F | Flag focused cell |
| Return | Chord (or new game from the game-over screen) |

## Implementation notes

- The package is split into a library (`SwiftSweeperKit`) and an executable (`SwiftSweeper`) so the game logic is unit-testable without dragging SwiftUI/AppKit into tests.
- **`ClickDispatcher`** captures every left/right mouseDown at the app level via `NSEvent.addLocalMonitorForEvents`. It computes which cell was hit and dispatches directly to the view model. This works around a SwiftUI/Liquid-Glass event-delivery quirk where trackpad clicks with accumulating `clickCount` get silently dropped before reaching `NSHostingView.mouseDown`. Per-cell `RightClickableView` is gone — cells are visual only.
- Custom board dimensions persist via `@AppStorage`; the Custom sheet uses typeable text fields plus steppers with bounds clamped to a first-tap safe zone.
